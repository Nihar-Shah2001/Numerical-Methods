# Numerical Methods
This repository is for developing Numerical Methods taught in the course Numerical Solutions of Differential equations and Numerical Methods at IISc using Parallel Computing. (in OpenMP). Future plans towards devveloping it using MPI. This repository currently has the following methods implemented:
- Bisection Method

I will add more numerical methods soon.
